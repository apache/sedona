/**
 * Base class for partition level join implementations.
 * <p>
 * Provides `match` method to test whether a given pair of geometries satisfies join condition.
 * <p>
 * Supports 'contains' and 'intersects' join conditions.
 * <p>
 * Provides optional de-dup logic. Due to the nature of spatial partitioning, the same pair of
 * geometries may appear in multiple partitions. If that pair satisfies join condition, it
 * will be included in join results multiple times. This duplication can be avoided by
 * (1) choosing spatial partitioning that doesn't allow for overlapping partition extents
 * and (2) reporting a pair of matching geometries only from the partition
 * whose extent contains the reference point of the intersection of the geometries.
 * <p>
 * To achieve (1), call SpatialRDD.spatialPartitioning with a GridType.QUADTREE. At the moment
 * this is the only grid type supported by de-dup logic.
 * <p>
 * For (2), provide `DedupParams` when instantiating JudgementBase object. If `DedupParams`
 * is specified, the implementation of the `match` method assumes that condition (1) holds.
