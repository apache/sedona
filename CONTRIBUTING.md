We appreciate bug fixes - thank you in advance!

## Would you like to add a new feature or change existing code?

If you would like to add a feature or change existing behavior, please make sure to create an issue/JIRA ticket and get the planned work approved by the core team first!

It's always better to get aligned with the core devs before writing any code.
