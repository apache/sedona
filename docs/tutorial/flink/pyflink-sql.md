To set up the PyFlink with Apache Sedona, please follow the guide. [PyFlink](../../setup/flink/install-python.md)
When you finish it, you can run the following code to test if everything works.

```python
from sedona.flink import SedonaContext
from pyflink.datastream import StreamExecutionEnvironment
from pyflink.table import EnvironmentSettings, StreamTableEnvironment

stream_env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
flink_settings = EnvironmentSettings.in_streaming_mode()
table_env = SedonaContext.create(stream_env, flink_settings)

table_env.\
    sql_query("SELECT ST_Point(1.0, 2.0)").\
    execute()
```

PyFlink does not expose the possibility of transforming Scala's own user-defined types (UDT) to Python UDT.
So, when you want to collect the result in Python, you need to use functions
like `ST_AsText` or `ST_ASBinary` to convert the result to a string or binary.

```python
from shapely.wkb import loads

table_env.\
    sql_query("SELECT ST_ASBinary(ST_Point(1.0, 2.0))").\
    execute().\
    collect()

[loads(bytes(el[0])) for el in result]
```

```
[<POINT (1 2)>]
```

Similar with User Defined Scalar functions

```python
from pyflink.table.udf import ScalarFunction, udf
from shapely.wkb import loads

class Buffer(ScalarFunction):
    def eval(self, s):
        geom = loads(s)
        return geom.buffer(1).wkb

table_env.create_temporary_function(
    "ST_BufferPython", udf(Buffer(), result_type="Binary")
)

buffer_table = table_env.sql_query(
    "SELECT ST_BufferPython(ST_ASBinary(ST_Point(1.0, 2.0))) AS buffer"
)
```

For more SQL examples please follow the FlinkSQL section [FlinkSQL](sql.md).
