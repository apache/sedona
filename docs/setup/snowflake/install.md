!!! note
    This tutorial is for you to manually install Sedona on Snowflake. If you want to use Sedona on Snowflake without manually installing it, you can use the free [SedonaSnow](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZF0RTY3/wherobots-sedonasnow) native app shipped by [Wherobots](https://wherobots.com/).

## Prerequisites

To install Sedona on Snowflake, you need to prepare a Snowflake account and a Snowflake user that can access at least one `DATABASE` and run at least one `WAREHOUSE`. Then you can follow the steps below to install Sedona on Snowflake.

You can refer to [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database) to how to create a DATABASE.

In this tutorial, we will use a database created by the following SQL statement. But you can use any database you want.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SEDONA_TEST;
```

## Step 1: Create a stage in the database

A stage is a Snowflake object that maps to a location in a cloud storage provider, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. You can use a stage to load data into a table, or unload data from a table.

In this case, we will create a stage named `ApacheSedona` in the `public` schema of the database created in the previous step. The stage will be used to load Sedona's JAR files into the database. We will choose a `Snowflake managed` stage.

After creating the stage, you should be able to see the stage in the database.

You can refer to [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stage.html) to how to create a stage.

## Step 2: Upload Sedona's JAR files to the stage

You will need to download the following 2 JAR files:

* sedona-snowflake-{{ sedona.current_version }}.jar: [Sedona's Maven Central repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.sedona/sedona-snowflake/versions)
* geotools-wrapper-{{ sedona.current_geotools }}.jar: [GeoTools-wrapper's Maven Central repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.datasyslab/geotools-wrapper/versions)

Then you can upload the 2 JAR files to the stage created in the previous step.

After uploading the 2 JAR files, you should be able to see the 2 JAR files in the stage.

You can refer to [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/put.html) to how to upload files to a stage.

## Step 3: Create a schema in the database

A schema is a Snowflake object that maps to a database. You can use a schema to organize your tables into groups based on business functions or other categories.

In this case, we will create a schema named `SEDONA` in the database created in the previous step. The schema will be used to create Sedona's functions.

![Create a schema in the database](../../image/snowflake/snowflake-4.png)

You can find your schema in the database as follows:

You can refer to [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html) to how to create a schema.

## Step 4: Get the SQL script for creating Sedona's functions

You will need to get this SQL script by running the following command:

```bash
java -jar sedona-snowflake-{{ sedona.current_version }}.jar --geotools-version {{ sedona.current_geotools }} > sedona-snowflake.sql
```

sedona-snowflake-{{ sedona.current_version }}.jar is the JAR file downloaded in Step 2.

## Step 5: Run the SQL script to create Sedona's functions

We will create a worksheet in the database created in the previous step, and run the SQL script to create Sedona's functions.

In this case, we will choose the option `Create Worksheet from SQL File`.

![Create Worksheet from SQL File](../../image/snowflake/snowflake-6.png)

In the worksheet, choose `SEDONA_TEST` as the database, and `PUBLIC` as the schema. The SQL script should be in the worksheet. Then right-click the worksheet and choose `Run All`. Snowflake will take 3 minutes to create Sedona's functions.

## Step 6: Verify the installation

Open a new worksheet, choose `SEDONA_TEST` as the database, and any schema as the schema. Then run the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT SEDONA.ST_AsEWKT(SEDONA.ST_SETSRID(SEDONA.ST_POINT(1, 2), 4326));
```

You should be able to see the following result:

```
SRID=4326;POINT (1 2)
```

The worksheet should look like this:
