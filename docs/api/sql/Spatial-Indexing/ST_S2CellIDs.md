# ST_S2CellIDs

Introduction: Cover the geometry with Google S2 Cells, return the corresponding cell IDs with the given level.
The level indicates the [size of cells](https://s2geometry.io/resources/s2cell_statistics.html). With a bigger level,
the cells will be smaller, the coverage will be more accurate, but the result size will be exponentially increasing.

Format: `ST_S2CellIDs(geom: Geometry, level: Integer)`

Return type: `Array<Long>`

Since: `v1.4.0`

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_S2CellIDs(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(1 3 4, 5 6 7)'), 6)
```

Output:

```
[1159395429071192064, 1159958379024613376, 1160521328978034688, 1161084278931456000, 1170091478186196992, 1170654428139618304]
