## ST_Envelope

Introduction: This function returns the bounding box (envelope) of A. It's important to note that the bounding box is calculated using a cylindrical topology, not a spherical one. If the envelope crosses the antimeridian (the 180Â° longitude line), you can set the split parameter to true. This will return a Geography object containing two separate Polygon objects, split along that line.

Format:

`ST_Envelope (A: Geography, splitAtAntiMeridian: Boolean)`

Since: `v1.8.0`

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_Envelope(ST_GeogFromWKT('MULTIPOLYGON (((177.285 -18.28799, 180 -18.28799, 180 -16.02088, 177.285 -16.02088, 177.285 -18.28799)), ((-180 -18.28799, -179.7933 -18.28799, -179.7933 -16.02088, -180 -16.02088, -180 -18.28799)))'), false);
```

Output:

```
POLYGON ((177.3 -18.3, -179.8 -18.3, -179.8 -16, 177.3 -16, 177.3 -18.3))
```
