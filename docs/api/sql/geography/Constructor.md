## ST_GeogFromWKT

Introduction: Construct a Geography from WKT. If SRID is not set, it defaults to 0 (unknown).

!!!note  The output WKT string uses the FIXED precision model, but all computations are performed using JTSâ€™s default 16-digit precision model. Users can specify a different precision model when converting to a string if needed.

Format:

`ST_GeogFromWKT (Wkt: String)`

`ST_GeogFromWKT (Wkt: String, srid: Integer)`

Since: `v1.8.0`

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_GeogFromWKT('LINESTRING (1 2, 3 4, 5 6)')
```

Output:

```
LINESTRING (1 2, 3 4, 5 6)
```

SQL Example:

```sql
SELECT ST_GeogFromWKT('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (50 50), LINESTRING (20 30, 40 60, 80 90), POLYGON ((35 15, 45 15, 40 25, 35 15), (30 10, 40 20, 30 20, 30 10)))')
```

Output:

```
GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (50 50), LINESTRING (20 30, 40 60, 80 90), POLYGON ((35 15, 45 15, 40 25, 35 15), (30 10, 40 20, 30 20, 30 10)))
```

## ST_GeogFromEWKT

Introduction: Construct a Geography from OGC Extended WKT.

Format:
`ST_GeogFromEWKT (EWkt: String)`

Since: `v1.8.0`

SQL example:

```sql
SELECT ST_GeogFromEWKT('SRID=4326;LINESTRING (0 0, 3 3, 4 4)')
```

Output:

```
LINESTRING (0 0, 3 3, 4 4)
```


## ST_GeogFromWKB

Introduction: Construct a Geography from WKB Binary.

Format:

`ST_GeogFromWKB (Wkb: Binary)`

Since: `v1.8.0`

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_GeogFromWKB([01 02 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 84 d6 00 c0 00 00 00 00 80 b5 d6 bf 00 00 00 60 e1 ef f7 bf 00 00 00 80 07 5d e5 bf])
```

Output:

```
LINESTRING (-2.1 -0.4, -1.5 -0.7)
```

## ST_GeogFromEWKB

Introduction: Construct a Geography from EWKB Binary. This function is an alias of [ST_GeogFromWKB](#st_geogfromwkb).

Format:
`ST_GeogFromEWKB (EWkb: Binary)`

Since: `v1.8.0`
