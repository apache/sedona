# ST_Force4D

Introduction: Converts the input geometry to 4D XYZM representation. Retains original Z and M values if present. Assigning 0.0 defaults if `mValue` and `zValue` aren't specified. The output contains X, Y, Z, and M coordinates. For geometries already in 4D form, the function returns the original geometry unmodified.

!!!Note
    Example output is after calling ST_AsText() on returned geometry, which adds Z for in the WKT for 3D geometries

Format:

`ST_Force4D(geom: Geometry, zValue: Double, mValue: Double)`

`ST_Force4D(geom: Geometry`

Return type: `Geometry`

Since: `v1.6.1`

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 0 2,0 5 2,5 0 2,0 0 2),(1 1 2,3 1 2,1 3 2,1 1 2))'), 5, 10))
```

Output:

```
POLYGON ZM((0 0 2 10, 0 5 2 10, 5 0 2 10, 0 0 2 10), (1 1 2 10, 3 1 2 10, 1 3 2 10, 1 1 2 10))
```

SQL Example

```sql
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 1,1 0,2 0)'), 3, 1))
```

Output:

```
LINESTRING ZM(0 1 3 1, 1 0 3 1, 2 0 3 1)
```
