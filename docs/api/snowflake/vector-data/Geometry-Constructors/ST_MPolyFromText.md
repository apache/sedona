# ST_MPolyFromText

Introduction: Construct a MultiPolygon from Wkt. If srid is not set, it defaults to 0 (unknown).

![ST_MPolyFromText](../../../../image/ST_MPolyFromText/ST_MPolyFromText.svg "ST_MPolyFromText")

Format:
`ST_MPolyFromText (Wkt:string)`
`ST_MPolyFromText (Wkt:string, srid:integer)`

Return type: `Geometry`

SQL example:

```sql
SELECT ST_MPolyFromText('MULTIPOLYGON(((0 0 1,20 0 1,20 20 1,0 20 1,0 0 1),(5 5 3,5 7 3,7 7 3,7 5 3,5 5 3)))')
```

Output:

```
MULTIPOLYGON (((0 0, 20 0, 20 20, 0 20, 0 0), (5 5, 5 7, 7 7, 7 5, 5 5)))
```
