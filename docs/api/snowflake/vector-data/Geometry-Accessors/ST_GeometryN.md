# ST_GeometryN

Introduction: Return the 0-based Nth geometry if the geometry is a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION, (MULTI)POINT, (MULTI)LINESTRING, MULTICURVE or (MULTI)POLYGON. Otherwise, return null

Format: `ST_GeometryN(geom: geometry, n: Int)`

SQL example:

```sql
SELECT ST_GeometryN(ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOINT((1 2), (3 4), (5 6), (8 9))'), 1)
```

Output: `POINT (3 4)`
