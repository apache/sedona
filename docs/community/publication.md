# Publication

Apache Sedona was formerly called GeoSpark, initiated by Arizona State University [Data Systems Lab](https://www.datasyslab.net/).

## Key publications

**"Spatial Data Management in Apache Spark: The
GeoSpark Perspective and Beyond"** is the full research paper that talks about the entire GeoSpark ecosystem. Please cite this paper if your work mentions GeoSpark core system.

**"GeoSparkViz: A Scalable Geospatial Data Visualization Framework in the Apache Spark Ecosystem"** is the full research paper that talks about map visualization system in GeoSpark. Please cite this paper if your work mentions GeoSpark visualization system.

**"Building A Microscopic Road Network Traffic Simulator in Apache Spark"** is the full research paper that talks about the traffic simulator in GeoSpark. Please cite this paper if your work mentions GeoSparkSim traffic simulator.

## Third-party evaluation

GeoSpark were evaluated by papers published on database top venues. It is worth noting that we do not have any collaboration with the authors.

* SIGMOD 2020 paper ["Architecting a Query Compiler for Spatial Workloads"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3318464.3389701) Ruby Y. Tahboub, Tiark  Rompf (Purdue University).

> In Figure 16a, GeoSpark distance join query runs around 7x - 9x faster than Simba, a spatial extension on Spark, on 1 - 24 core machines.

* PVLDB 2018 paper ["How Good Are Modern Spatial Analytics Systems?"](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1661-pandey.pdf) Varun Pandey, Andreas Kipf, Thomas Neumann, Alfons Kemper (Technical University of Munich), quoted as follows:

> GeoSpark comes close to a complete spatial analytics system. It also exhibits the best performance in most cases.
