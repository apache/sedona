## Issue tracker

### Bug Reports

Found bug? Enter an issue in the [Sedona JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SEDONA)

Before submitting an issue, please:

* Verify that the bug does in fact exist.
* Search the issue tracker to verify there is no existing issue reporting the bug you’ve found.
* Consider tracking down the bug yourself in the Sedona’s source and submitting a patch along with your bug report. This is a great time saver for the Sedona developers and helps ensure the bug will be fixed quickly.

### Feature Requests

Enhancement requests for new features are also welcome. The more concrete and rationale the request is, the greater the chance it will be incorporated into future releases.
